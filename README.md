# Master Key Memory Interface #
This core provides a 32-bit interface to a master key memory (MKM)
implemented using an external volatile memory.

The memory targeted is
([Microchip 23K640](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/23K640)), a
serial SRAM with a SPI interface.

## Purpose and Functionality ##
The Master Key Memory is where a cryptographic master key is stored. the
key is used (for example) to cryptographically wrap other keys and
secrets. By wiping the MKM and thus the master key, the wrapped secrets
are protected against leakage to an attacker.

The core will in a future version provide functionality to autonomosly
protect against memory remanence effects by rotating bits in stored data
and moving data to different addresses in the external memory. The core
will also be able to automously zeroise the memory when given an alarm.

The current version however simply provides an interface to the slower,
serial memory.

Read and write commands given while ready is low will be ignored.


## Limitations ##
The SPI clock is generated by the core clock (clk) divided by the
SPI clock divisor * 2 (the divisor is the half period in cycles). The
default divisor is set to generate an SPI clock of less than 1 MHz when
the core clock is 50 MHz. For other speeds and other
core frequencies the divisor will have to be adjusted.

The core will only write complete 32-bit words.


## Implementation ##
The current implementation will initiate the Microchip memory directly
after reset and set the memory in sequential mode. This means that it
would actually be possible to write a stream of data to the memory, but
since the API only handles a single 32-bit word, the mode is only used
to remove the need to update the address between bytes.
