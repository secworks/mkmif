# Master Key Memory Interface #
This core provides a 32-bit interface to a master key memory (MKM)
implemented using an external volatile memory.

The memory targeted is
([Microchip 23K640](https://www.microchip.com/wwwproducts/en/23K640)), a
serial SRAM with a SPI interface.

## Purpose and Functionality ##
The Master Key Memory is where a cryptographic master key is stored. the
key is used (for example) to cryptographically wrap other keys and
secrets. By wiping the MKM and thus the master key, the wrapped secrets
are protected against leakage to an attacker.

The core will in a future version provide functionality to autonomosly
protect against memory remanence effects by rotating bits in stored data
and moving data to different addresses in the external memory. The core
will also be able to automously zeroise the memory when given an alarm.

The current version however simply provides an interface to the slower,
serial memory.

Commands to read and write when ready is low will be ignored.


## Limitations ##
The SPI clock is generated by the core clock (clk) divided by the
SPI clock divisor. The default divisor is set to generate an SPI clock
of 100 kHz when the core clock is 50 MHz. For other speeds and other
core frequencies the divisor will have to be adjusted.

The core will only write complete 32-bit words.


## Implementation ##

To Be Written.


## Status ##

**(2016-04-25)**

Refactored core into top_-, core- and spi-modules. Made the design much
simpler. First implementation almost completed.


**(2016-04-21)**

Core implementation started.
